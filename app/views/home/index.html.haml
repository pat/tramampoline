%p.summary Trampoline is a self-organising event for those who find the world interesting, have something to offer and share, and have an inquisitive mind.

%p Attendees are expected to come along with participation in mind and share what they find amazing to an audience that is up for cross disciplinary discussion.

  The day at Trampoline is filled with sessions offered by attendees on the day - nothing is given priority, nothing is locked in before we start. Each session is 20 minutes long, and is focused on sharing something that the presenter finds amazing. Sometimes they can be talks, or group discussions, or tutorials. You can structure your session how you wish.

%p There's no expectation that those speaking are experts (though a little knowledge usually helps). <strong>Participation is key</strong>.

%p At any given point, there will be four or five sessions happening - so you can either choose one discussion, or wander between a few - there's no expectation to stay put.

%h2 Getting Involved

%p Want to be a part of the conversations around Trampoline before and after the actual event? It mostly takes place, via <a href="http://twitter.com/trampolineday">Twitter</a> and <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/trampoline-melb">the Google Group</a>.

%p The latter in particular is a great way to communicate with many Trampoline attendees - perhaps following up on topics that were discussed, sharing further ideas, or putting together ideas for the next event.

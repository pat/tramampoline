Hi there,

Registrations for Trampoline are now open! It's going to be an awesome day and there are a limited number of places open, so be quick!

Register a ticket now on our website:

http://trampolineday.com/register

This Trampoline will be happening on Saturday, April 16th, from 9am to 6pm, and is at Circus Oz's training space at 40 Bay Street in Port Melbourne.

Just like last time, if you sign up now, you'll get an invite to pass on to someone who hasn't attended Trampoline before.

Good luck with your registrations and see you soon!

Peace, love and sticky rice.

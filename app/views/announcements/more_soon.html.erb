<html><body style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space; ">Hi there,<br><br>As you may have heard, the tickets we released a couple of weeks ago got snapped up in two hours. For those of you who missed out, you've still got a chance of attending: not all invites have been accepted, and a few who signed up can no longer make it, so <b>we have spare tickets!</b><br><br>We will be releasing these spares on <b>Monday the 13th of September at 10AM</b>. If the last release is anything to go by, these could disappear quickly as well, so make sure you've got the time and date in your diary.<br><br>Peace, love and sticky rice.<br><br>-- <br><%= team_string %><br>Trampoline<br></body></html>

Hi there,

As you may have heard, the tickets we released a couple of weeks ago got snapped up in two hours. For those of you who missed out, you've still got a chance of attending: not all invites have been accepted, and a few who signed up can no longer make it, so we have spare tickets!

We will be releasing these spares on Monday the 13th of September at 10AM. If the last release is anything to go by, these could disappear quickly as well, so make sure you've got the time and date in your diary.

Peace, love and sticky rice.

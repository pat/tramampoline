Hi there!

It's with great pleasure that we can announce that the next Melbourne Trampoline will be held on Sunday 26th of September. This time, we're moving to a fantastic new venue, Circus Oz's training space and offices in Port Melbourne.

We hope you can make it to join in the fun once more as we share what we find amazing with those whom we perhaps don't normally get a chance to connect with.

Ticket registrations will be available at 10am on Thursday the 26th of August (one month before the event). Like the last time, if you get your ticket quickly, you'll get a second to hand out to someone who hasn't been to a Trampoline before. As always, Trampoline is looking to bring together a diverse crowd who are eager in sharing ideas from a mix of disciplines.

So: Lock in the 26th of September in your calendars. Mark your diary for the 26th of August so you can register quickly and maybe begin thinking about who you might like to bring along or what you may want to speak about this time!

Once again, Trampoline is made possible by contributions from the community. This time around, we have a web page set up for donations already - all contributions are greatly appreciated.

See you soon!

Peace, love and sticky rice.

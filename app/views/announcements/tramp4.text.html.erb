<html><body><div>Hi there!</div><div><br></div><div>It's with great pleasure that we can announce that the next Melbourne&nbsp;<a href="http://trampolineday.com">Trampoline</a>&nbsp;will be held on <b>Sunday 26th of September</b>. This time, we're moving to a fantastic new venue,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.circusoz.com">Circus Oz</a>'s training space and offices in Port Melbourne.</div><div><br></div><div>We hope you can make it to join in the fun once more as we share what we find amazing with those whom we perhaps don't normally get a chance to connect with.</div><div><br></div><div>Ticket registrations will be available at <b>10am</b> on <b>Thursday the 26th of August</b> (one month before the event). Like the last time, if you get your ticket quickly, you'll get a second to hand out to someone who hasn't been to a Trampoline before. As always, Trampoline is looking to bring together a diverse crowd who are eager in sharing ideas from a mix of disciplines.</div><div><br></div><div>So: Lock in <b>the 26th of September</b> in your calendars. Mark your diary for <b>the 26th of August</b> so you can register quickly and maybe begin thinking about who you might like to bring along or what you may want to speak about this time!</div><div><br></div><div>Once again, Trampoline is made possible by contributions from the community. This time around, we have&nbsp;<a href="http://pledgie.com/campaigns/12668">a web page set up for donations</a>&nbsp;already - all contributions are greatly appreciated.</div><div><br></div><div>See you soon!</div><div><br></div><div>Peace, love and sticky rice.</div><div><br></div><div>--&nbsp;</div><div><%= team_string %>.</div><div><br></div></body></html>

%h2 Register for Trampoline

%p You can book your spot at Trampoline by filling out this form. There is <strong>no cost</strong> to attend the event - but places are limited, so please register promptly!

- unless @attendee.invited? || all_released?
  %p When you register, you will be given a special website link for someone else to register as well. We would like you to give this link to someone who <strong>hasn't been to Trampoline before</strong> - ideally, someone who works in a different field to yourself.
  
  %p If you know right now who you want to invite, give us their email address, and we'll send them the invitation and website link directly.
  
  %p This is to ensure that Trampoline attendees continue to have a fantastic mix of interests and expertise - it's this mix that makes it such a great event!

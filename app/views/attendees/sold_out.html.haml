%p.summary Sorry, Trampoline is booked out!

- if all_released?
  %p We'd love to have you there, but unfortunately we have some size constraints with the venue. We'll be doing our best next time we'll fit some more people in, and we hope you'll be one of them!
- else
  %p We will be releasing any unconfirmed tickets on Thursday April 29th, at 10:00am - please do try again then! (There won't be many, and they will go quickly, so it's best to set a reminder for yourself).

%p To keep track of the latest, make sure you're on the <a href="/subscribers/new">announcements mailing list</a>.

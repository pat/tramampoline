Hi everyone!

Trampoline is now just over a week away, on Sunday the 9th of October! A few things to ponder before the big day:

* Who pays for all this?

We've received some support from our fantastic sponsors: Circus Oz, Ergo Consulting, Web Directions, Nodecity and Strategic Games Lab - but this doesn't cover all our costs. We're expecting everything to cost around $3000, so if you can pitch in to help us stay in the black, that would be greatly appreciated.

* Presenting on the day - what will you be talking about?

A reminder that anyone can present at Trampoline. To find out more about the format of Trampoline, and some tips on how to construct your presentation, have a read of our essential guide to the day. Get ready to share those things you find amazing in this world!

Looking forward to seeing you on the day!

Peace, love and sticky rice.

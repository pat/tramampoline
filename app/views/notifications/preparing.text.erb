Hi everyone!

Trampoline is now only a few days away, on <%= @event.happens_on.to_s :day_and_date %>! In preparation for a fun and interesting day, we want to get the creative juices flowing early... but first, the key details:

* From 10:00am to 5:00pm, <%= @event.happens_on.to_s :day_and_date %>.
* <%= @event.venue %>, <%= @event.address %> - <%= @event.map_uri %>

* Presenting on the day - what will you be talking about?

Don't stress - we're not going to force you to present, but we're certainly looking forward to hearing what interesting ideas, stories and skills everyone will share on the day.

If you've not been to a Trampoline before, here's a few links for some background:

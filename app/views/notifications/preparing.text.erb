Hi everyone!

Trampoline is now only a week away, on Sunday the 26th of September! A few things to ponder before the big day:

* Who pays for all this?

We've received some support from our fantastic sponsors: Circus Oz, AI Media, Ergo Consulting, Web Directions, Lantern and Nodecity - but this doesn't cover all our costs. We're expecting everything to cost around $2500, so if you can pitch in to help us stay in the black, that would be greatly appreciated.

* Presenting on the day - what will you be talking about?

A reminder that anyone can present at Trampoline. To find out more about the format of Trampoline, and some tips on how to construct your presentation, have a read of our essential guide to the day. Get ready to share those things you find amazing in this world!

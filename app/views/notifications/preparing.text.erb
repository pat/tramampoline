Hi everyone!

Trampoline is now only a week away, on Sunday the 9th of October! While we'll be in touch during the week with the final details, we just want to get the creative juices flowing early...

* Presenting on the day - what will you be talking about?

A reminder that anyone can present at Trampoline. To find out more about the format of Trampoline, and some tips on how to construct your presentation, have a read of our essential guide to the day. Get ready to share those things you find amazing in this world!

* Welcoming Nick to the team

As noted at the last Trampoline in Melbourne, Mel and Steve are focusing more on getting Trampolines happening in their current locations (Cambodia and Sydney, respectively).

This has provided us with the great opportunity to increase the diversity and bring some new blood into the Melbourne team - and so we welcome Nick Harvey as the new member of the organising group, certain that he will help make Trampoline amazing.

Looking forward to seeing you on the day!

Peace, love and sticky rice.

Hi everyone!

Trampoline is now only a week away, on Saturday the 31st of March! While we'll be in touch during the week with the final details, we just want to get the creative juices flowing early...

* Presenting on the day - what will you be talking about?

A reminder that anyone can present at Trampoline. To find out more about the format of Trampoline, and some tips on how to construct your presentation, have a read of our essential guide to the day. Get ready to share those things you find amazing in this world!

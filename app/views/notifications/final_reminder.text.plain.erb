Hi everyone!

One last email, just to make sure you have all the key details for Sunday.

* From 9:00am to 6:00pm, Sunday 26th of September.
* Circus Oz, 40 Bay Street, Port Melbourne 3207 - http://goo.gl/maps/f8A2

For those of you driving, give yourself 15 minutes to find a park, and take notice of the zoning - time limits are apparently enforced regularly. For those taking public transport, Tram 109 to the end of the line is your best bet - then it's a short walk south.

Don't forget to keep thinking through what you may want to share on the day. We also highly recommend a read through of the guide on how Trampoline works.

If you've got any last minute questions or problems, please don't hesitate to get in touch - either by email, or give Pat a call on 0413 273 337. We are very much looking forward to meeting and bouncing with you on Sunday!

Peace, love, and sticky rice

Hi everyone,

Thanks again for attending Trampoline! It was great to see more than 40 people stand up and share what they found amazing last Sunday at Circus Oz. We were stoked to see so many new faces amongst all those who made it.

Our appreciation also goes out to our sponsors: Circus Oz, Ergo Consulting, AI Media, Web Directions, Nodecity and Lantern. Thanks for getting our backs.

As discussed on the day, while Trampoline is a free event there is some cost involved to make it happen. So, if you can pitch in to cover costs via the pledgie website, that would be greatly appreciated. A huge thanks for those who have contributed already!

* Look at the photos

There is also a growing collection of photos online on Flickr, all part of the Trampoline group. We’d love to see more appear there - if you’re not sure how to do this, there are some pointers on their site.

* Future Trampolines
 
There are already plans for the next Trampoline - which will probably happen in the first half of next year. News about this will go out via the announcements mailing list and the discussion group on Google. It’s best to make sure you’re signed up for either of these to hear the latest information.

* Videos on their way

Nathan's working hard on trawling through all the footage from the day, and will have the videos up on Vimeo as soon as possible. We'll be sure to let the mailing list know when they're up. If you have some videos of your own to share, please add them to the Vimeo channel.

Once again, thank you to all who helped make last Sunday such an amazing day - our volunteers, our sponsors, and everyone who participated.

Peace, love and sticky rice

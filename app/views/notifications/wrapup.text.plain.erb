Hi everyone,

Thanks again for attending Trampoline! It was great to see more than 40 people stand up and share what they found amazing last Sunday at Donkey Wheel House. We were stoked to see so many new faces amongst all those who made it.
 
Our appreciation also goes out to our sponsors: Donkey Wheel, Nodecity, Pollenizer and Web Directions. Thanks for getting our backs.

As discussed on the day, while Trampoline is a free event there is some cost involved to make it happen. So, if you can pitch in to cover costs via the pledgie website, that would be greatly appreciated. A huge thanks for those who have contributed already!

* Watch the videos

If you would like to re-live the magic, check out the Trampoline channel on the video-sharing site Vimeo. A massive thanks to Nathan Sampimon who has done an amazing job at processing and uploading videos of the sessions so quickly.

* Look at the photos

There is also a growing collection of photos online on Flickr, all part of the Trampoline group. We’d love to see more appear there - if you’re not sure how to do this, there are some pointers on their site.

There are already plans for the next Trampoline - which will probably happen towards the end of this year.  News about this will go out via the announcements mailing list and the discussion group on Google. It’s best to make sure you’re signed up for either of these to hear the latest information.

Once again, thank you to all who helped make last Sunday such an amazing day - our volunteers, our sponsors, and everyone who participated.

Peace, love and sticky rice

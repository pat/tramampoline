Hi everyone,

Thanks again for attending Trampoline! It was great to see so many people stand up and share what they found amazing at Circus Oz. We were stoked to see so many new faces amongst all those who made it.

Our appreciation also goes out to our sponsors: Circus Oz, Ergo Consulting and Web Directions. Thanks for getting our backs.

* Look at the photos

There is also a growing collection of photos online on the photo-sharing website Flickr, all part of the Trampoline group. We’d love to see more appear there - if you’re not sure how to do this, there are some pointers on their site.

If you've any thoughts on the day - what was good, what needs work - let us know, we're keen to keep improving and evolving Trampoline.


Once again, thank you to all who helped make Trampoline such an amazing day - our volunteers, our sponsors, and everyone who participated.

Peace, love and sticky rice

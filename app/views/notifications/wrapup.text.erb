Hello everyone!

It was great to bounce ideas together and learn about the things people find amazing.

We look forward to Trampolining again, and keep up with the friends we made as well. As John K noted on Twitter last week - it was an incredibly intimate event. We started the day with a mixed-bag of strangers, and we all left with new friends.

It would be great to see you in the Facebook group we've set up. Perhaps you can share links to some of the things you find amazing that we talked about on that Sunday?

John B has already posted a few links from the weekend, including to a Storify story, which brings tweets and pictures from the weekend together into one place. Storify is a great way to capture the conversation for posterity.

We'd love to Trampoline again in six months time - tweet @trampolineday or use the Facebook group to tap someone on the shoulder if you want to help make this happen.

Once again, thank you to all who helped make Trampoline such an amazing day - our volunteers and supporters, and everyone who participated.

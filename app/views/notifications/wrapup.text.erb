Hi everyone,

It's been a few weeks, but thanks again for attending Trampoline Sydney! It was great to see so many people stand up and share what they found amazing.

Our appreciation also goes out to our sponsors: Oxford Street Design Store, Home/Work, Fishburners and Knowledge Bird. Thanks for getting our backs.

You're also welcome to email us should those questions not cover everyone you'd like to tell us.

* Trampoline Discussions

If there's any ideas that have particularly resonated from the event, feel free to discuss these on our Google discussion group - Tom Dawkins has already kicked things off with some notes and slides from his crowdfunding session.

* Look at the photos

There is also a growing collection of photos online on the photo-sharing website Flickr, all part of the Trampoline group. We’d love to see more appear there - if you’re not sure how to do this, there are some pointers on their site.

Once again, thank you to all who helped make Trampoline such an amazing day - our volunteers, our sponsors, and everyone who participated.

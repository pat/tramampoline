Hi everyone,

Thanks for attending Trampoline Northcote - it was great day with a terrific mix of people and ideas.

* Supporting Trampoline

As mentioned at the close of the event, while we were hopeful of lining up sponsors for this Trampoline, it didn't happen, and so we're a little short on funds. For those who do want to help us cover the venue hire, here's a site where you can donate:

* Future Trampolines

News about future events will go out via the announcements mailing list. To stay in the loop, sign up here:

* Feedback

We'd love some feedback on what you thought of the day. If you have a spare minute, here's our survey - it's just a handful of questions:

You're also welcome to email us should those questions not cover everyone you'd like to tell us.

* Other events

The next Trampoline in Melbourne will likely be in Spring - but if you're after other brainfood, you may want to check out the Creative Performance Exchange (CPX), run by Peter Spence - they've got some fantastic sessions coming up over the next few weeks:

* Trampoline Discussions

If there's any ideas that have particularly resonated from the event, feel free to discuss these on our Google discussion group.

* Look at the photos

There is also a growing collection of photos online on the photo-sharing website Flickr, all part of the Trampoline group. We'd love to see more appear there - if you're not sure how to do this, there are some pointers on their site.

Once again, thank you to all who helped make Trampoline such an amazing day - our volunteers and supporters, and everyone who participated.

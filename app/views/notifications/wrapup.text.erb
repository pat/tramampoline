Hello everyone!

While it's been a couple of months now, we're still buzzing from the recent Trampoline in Adelaide. It was great to bounce ideas together and learn about the things people find amazing.

Your feedback on the day is certainly valued - we want to make the next event even better. If you have a spare minute or two, can you fill out our survey? It's not long!

We look forward to Trampolining again - indeed, we're pretty stoked to let you know that our next event already has a date locked in: Sunday, October 27th. When tickets are available, we'll be getting word out through our mailing list.

It would be great to see you in the Facebook group we've set up. Perhaps you can share links to some of the things you find amazing?

Once again, thank you to all who helped make Trampoline such an amazing day - our volunteers and supporters, and everyone who participated.

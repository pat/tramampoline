Hi there,

We're excited to have you joining us at Trampoline on the 16th, and we're looking forward to having a great mix of people come together to share what they find amazing.

When you signed up, we provided you with a special invite link that you can send to someone else who hasn't been to a Trampoline before. At this point, your link hasn't been used - and we would like to fit as many interested people in on the day, so we'll be releasing any spares on Wednesday.

So, if you've got someone in mind, please make sure they sign up before 6:00pm on the 30th of March - otherwise their ticket will be returned to the pool. Here's that link one more time:

See you soon!

Peace, love and sticky rice.

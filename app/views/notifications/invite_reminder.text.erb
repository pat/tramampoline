Hi there,

We're excited to have you joining us at Trampoline on the 31st, and we're looking forward to having a great mix of people come together to share what they find amazing.

When you signed up, we provided you with a special invite link that you can send to someone else who hasn't been to a Trampoline before. At this point, your link hasn't been used - and we would like to fit as many interested people in on the day, so we'll be releasing any spares on Saturday.

So, if you've got someone in mind, please make sure they sign up before midday on the 17th of March - otherwise their ticket will be returned to the pool. Here's that link one more time:

See you soon!

Peace, love and sticky rice.

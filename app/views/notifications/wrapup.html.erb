<p>Hi everyone,</p>

<p>Thanks for attending Trampoline Northcote - it was great day with a terrific mix of people and ideas.</p>

<p><b>Supporting Trampoline</b></p>

<p>As mentioned at the close of the event, while we were hopeful of lining up sponsors for this Trampoline, it didn't happen, and so we're a little short on funds. For those who do want to help us cover the venue hire, here's a site where you can donate:</p>

<p>There is also a growing collection of photos online on the photo-sharing website Flickr, all part of the Trampoline group. We'd love to see more appear there - if you're not sure how to do this, there are <a href="http://www.flickr.com/help/with/groups/">some pointers</a> on their site.</p>

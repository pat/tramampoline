Hi everyone!

One last email, just to make sure you have all the key details for <%= @event.happens_on.to_s :day %>.

* From 9:00am to 6:00pm, <%= @event.happens_on.to_s :day_and_date %>.
* <%= @event.venue %>, <%= @event.address %> - <%= @event.map_uri %>

Don't forget to keep thinking through what you may want to share on the day. We also highly recommend a read through of the guide on how Trampoline works.

Also, it is a little last minute, but we're after a couple of things perhaps you can help with: a projector to borrow for one of the session spaces, and a sponsor or two for the event. If you can source the former or work for an organisation that could be the latter, let us know.

If you've got any last minute questions or problems, please don't hesitate to get in touch - either by email, or give Steve a call on 0421 366 772. We are very much looking forward to meeting and bouncing with you on <%= @event.happens_on.to_s :day %>!

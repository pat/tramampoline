Hi everyone!

One last email, just to make sure you have all the key details for <%= @event.happens_on.to_s :day %>.

* From 9:00am to 6:00pm, <%= @event.happens_on.to_s :day_and_date %>.
* <%= @event.venue %>, <%= @event.address %> - <%= @event.map_uri %>

For those of you driving, give yourself 15 minutes to find a park, and take notice of the zoning - time limits are apparently enforced regularly. For those taking public transport, Tram 109 to the end of the line is your best bet - then it's a short walk south.

Don't forget to keep thinking through what you may want to share on the day. We also highly recommend a read through of the guide on how Trampoline works.

If you've got any last minute questions or problems, please don't hesitate to get in touch - either by email, or give Pat a call on 0413 273 337. We are very much looking forward to meeting and bouncing with you on <%= @event.happens_on.to_s :day %>!

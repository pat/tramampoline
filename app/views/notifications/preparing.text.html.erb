We're expecting everything to cost around $2500, so if you can&nbsp;<a href="http://pledgie.com/campaigns/12668">pitch in</a>&nbsp;to help us stay in the black, that would be greatly appreciated.</div><div><br></div><div><a href="http://pledgie.com/campaigns/12668">http://pledgie.com/campaigns/12668</a></div><div><b><br></b><b>Presenting on the day - what will you be talking about?</b><br>A reminder that anyone can present at Trampoline.

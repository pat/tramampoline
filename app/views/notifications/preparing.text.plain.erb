Hi everyone!

Trampoline is now only days away, on Sunday the 2nd of May! Trampoline 3 has come around a lot quicker than the sequel to Tron, that's for sure. A few things to ponder before the big day.

* Give someone your golden ticket.

Tickets which are still unregistered will be opened to the public on Thursday, the 29th of April, at 10am (that's tomorrow!). You need to get the link below to your golden ticket recipient today, and ensure they register.

* Who pays for all this?

We've received some support from our fantastic sponsors, Web Directions, Pollenizer and Nodecity - but this doesn't cover all our costs. We're expecting everything to cost around $1500, so if you can pitch in to help us stay in the black, that would be greatly appreciated.

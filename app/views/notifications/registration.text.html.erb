Hi <%= @attendee.name %><br><br>Thanks for registering for Trampoline on the <b>2nd of May</b>!<br><br>
<%- unless @attendee.invited? || all_released? -%>
<%- if @attendee.inviting? -%>
We've also sent an email to <%= @attendee.invite_email %> to see if they'd like to come along as well - just as you&nbsp;asked. If they don't, then you'll want to send on this special one-use-only registration link to someone else:<br><br><a href="http://trampolineday.com<%= accept_path(@attendee.invite_code) %>">http://trampolineday.com<%= accept_path(@attendee.invite_code) %></a><br><br>Please pass it on to someone who <b>hasn't been to a Trampoline before</b>! Make sure they register <b>before April 29th</b>,&nbsp;otherwise we might offer their place to the waiting list.<br><br>
<% else %>
Because you've registered nice and early, we've given you a second registration ticket that we'd like you to give to someone who hasn't been to a Trampoline before. You should send the following link to that friend, so we can ensure their place at Trampoline is reserved.
<br><br>
<a href="http://trampolineday.com<%= accept_path(@attendee.invite_code) %>">http://trampolineday.com<%= accept_path(@attendee.invite_code) %></a><br><br>
Make sure they register before April 29th, otherwise we might offer their place to the waiting list.<br><br>
<% end %>
<% end %>
We'll be in touch before the event starts, but please keep in mind that we'll be starting at 9am, and wrapping&nbsp;the day up at 6pm. Trampoline will be happening at the wonderful Donkey Wheel House, in the city at&nbsp;<a href="http://maps.google.com.au/maps?f=q&amp;source=embed&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=673+Bourke+Street,+Melbourne&amp;sll=-25.335448,135.745076&amp;sspn=58.82617,78.046875&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=673+Bourke+St,+Melbourne+Victoria+3000&amp;ll=-37.815005,144.957304&amp;spn=0.011866,0.018239&amp;z=15">673 Bourke&nbsp;Street</a>.<br><br>If it turns out you cannot make it, please let us know (by replying to this email), because we'd like to fit as&nbsp;many people as possible in on the day.<br><br>Looking forward to seeing you on Sunday the 2nd of May!<br><br>Peace, love and sticky rice<br><br>--&nbsp;<br>Steve, Pat, Aida and Mel<br>Trampoline<br><div><br></div></body></html>
